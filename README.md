# Integrated-Data-Processing-Pipeline-Project
Just built the full data pipeline! First, my Python scraper auto-collected images from the web. Then, I meticulously annotated them in Labelme for AI training. Finally, I visualized the dataset statistics with Matplotlib charts. This hands-on experiment gave me a complete, practical view of the data science workflow from raw data to insight.
